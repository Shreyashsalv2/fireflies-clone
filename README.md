# Fireflies Clone — Meeting Notes & Transcription Platform

This is my clone of [Fireflies.ai](https://fireflies.ai) — a meeting-assistant app where you can browse a
library of past meetings, open one to read an **interactive transcript** that's synced to a media player,
get **AI-generated** summaries / action items / topics, search across everything, and manage meetings
end-to-end.

Real speech-to-text was out of scope for this assignment, so I focused on recreating the *experience* and
the post-meeting workflows. Transcripts are either seeded, pasted, or uploaded, and the summaries are
generated with **Groq**. I also added a deterministic mock fallback, so the app still works even if there's
no API key set.

## What you can do

**The core stuff:**
- **Browse meetings** — a dashboard of cards with the title, date, duration, participants, and tags. You can
  search, filter by date, and sort by recency or title.
- **Read the transcript interactively** — every line has a speaker and a timestamp. Click a line and the
  player jumps to that moment; hit play and the active line highlights and auto-scrolls along with it. There's
  also a search box to find and jump between matches inside the transcript.
- **Play it back** — a media player with a seek bar and play/pause. Since audio was out of scope, this is a
  simulated timeline driven by the transcript timestamps (the spec allows a placeholder here).
- **AI notes** — each meeting gets a summary, extracted action items, and key topics generated from the
  transcript. The topics are clickable and seek the player to that point.
- **Full CRUD** — create a meeting by pasting or uploading a transcript (`.txt` / `.vtt` / `.json`), edit its
  details, delete it, and add / edit / complete / delete action items. Everything persists.

**Extras I added on top:**
- A global search page across every meeting (title, participants, summary, and transcript).
- Export a meeting's transcript + summary to **Markdown** or **plain text**.
- **Dark mode** (remembered between visits), a **collapsible sidebar** (a focus-mode toggle on desktop and a
  slide-in drawer on mobile), toasts on every action, and an account menu.
- "Coming soon" placeholders for the live bot, integrations, team/sharing, and real auth (I assume a single
  default logged-in user).

## What I used (and why)

I set this up as two apps in one repo:

- **Frontend** — Next.js 16 (App Router) with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS v4. I used TanStack Query for data
  fetching, lucide-react for icons, and sonner for toasts. The app is very interactive, so I built it as a
  client-rendered SPA.
- **Backend** — FastAPI with SQLModel (on SQLite) and Pydantic v2. I picked FastAPI because it gave me clean,
  typed endpoints and auto-generated Swagger docs with basically no extra work.
- **AI** — Groq (`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`). I ask it to return structured JSON so it maps straight into my
  database, and I wrapped the call so that a missing key or a failed request falls back to a local mock. That
  way, creating a meeting never breaks because of the AI step.

---

## How it fits together

The frontend is a client-rendered SPA that talks to the FastAPI backend over a plain REST API. The backend
owns the database and makes the Groq calls.

## How I modeled the data

I used SQLite through SQLModel. Everything hangs off the `meetings` table, and all the child rows
cascade-delete with their meeting so I never leave orphans behind.

```
meetings ──1:*── participants
   │      ──1:*── transcript_segments   (speaker, start_time, end_time, text, order_index)
   │      ──1:1── summaries             (overview, generated_by: seeded | groq | mock)
   │      ──1:*── action_items          (text, assignee?, completed, due_date?, order_index)
   │      ──1:*── topics                (title, start_time?  → clickable chapter)
   └──────*:*── tags                    (through a meeting_tags link table)
```

| Table | Key columns |
|---|---|
| `meetings` | id, title, description, meeting_date, duration_seconds, media_url, created_at, updated_at |
| `participants` | id, meeting_id →, name, email?, role? |
| `transcript_segments` | id, meeting_id →, speaker, start_time, end_time, text, order_index |
| `summaries` | id, meeting_id → (unique), overview, generated_by, created_at, updated_at |
| `action_items` | id, meeting_id →, text, assignee?, completed, due_date?, order_index, created_at |
| `topics` | id, meeting_id →, title, start_time?, order_index |
| `tags` / `meeting_tags` | id, name (unique) / (meeting_id, tag_id) |

I keep a `generated_by` flag on each summary (`seeded`, `groq`, or `mock`) so the UI can show where it came
from, and every transcript segment carries `start_time` / `end_time` — that's what powers the click-to-seek
and the highlight-follows-playback behavior.

## The API

Everything lives under `/api`, and FastAPI serves interactive docs at **`/docs`** if you want to try the
endpoints directly.

| Method | Endpoint | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/meetings` | List meetings; supports `search`, `participant`, `meeting_date`, `sort` |
| POST | `/meetings` | Create from `transcript_text` or `segments`; kicks off the AI summary |
| POST | `/meetings/upload` | Create from an uploaded transcript file (multipart) |
| GET | `/meetings/{id}` | Full meeting detail |
| PATCH | `/meetings/{id}` | Edit title / description / participants / tags |
| DELETE | `/meetings/{id}` | Delete a meeting |
| POST | `/meetings/{id}/generate-summary` | Regenerate the summary / action items / topics |
| POST | `/meetings/{id}/action-items` | Add an action item |
| PATCH | `/action-items/{id}` | Edit / complete an action item |
| DELETE | `/action-items/{id}` | Delete an action item |
| GET | `/search?q=` | Global search across all meetings |
| GET | `/meetings/{id}/export?format=md\|txt` | Export the transcript + summary |
| GET | `/api/health` | Health check |

## Running it locally

You'll need **Node.js 20.9+** and **Python 3.11+**.

### 1) Backend (`backend/`)
```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env               # optional: drop in your GROQ_API_KEY for real AI summaries
python -m app.seed                 # seeds 5 sample meetings
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```
The API runs at http://localhost:8000, and the docs are at http://localhost:8000/docs. The database also
auto-seeds itself if it's empty on startup, so the app is never blank.

### 2) Frontend (`frontend/`)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                        # http://localhost:3000
```
By default the frontend points at `http://localhost:8000/api`. If your backend is somewhere else, set
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `frontend/.env.local`.

## Environment variables

**Backend** (`backend/.env`)
| Variable | What it's for | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Groq key for real summaries. Leave blank to use the mock fallback. | *(empty)* |
| `GROQ_MODEL` | Which Groq model to use | `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | Allowed CORS origin (my Vercel URL in production) | `http://localhost:3000` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | SQLAlchemy database URL | `sqlite:///./fireflies.db` |

**Frontend** (`frontend/.env.local`)
| Variable | What it's for | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | Backend base URL, including `/api` | `http://localhost:8000/api` |

I keep all secrets in local `.env` files (which are gitignored) or in the hosting dashboard — nothing
sensitive is committed.

## How I deployed it

I put the **backend on Render** and the **frontend on Vercel**.

**Backend → Render**
1. New Web Service from this repo, with **Root Directory `backend`** (there's a `render.yaml` blueprint too).
2. Build command `pip install -r requirements.txt`, start command
   `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`.
3. Set `GROQ_API_KEY` (and `FRONTEND_URL` = the Vercel URL) in the dashboard.

**Frontend → Vercel**
1. Import the repo with **Root Directory `frontend`**.
2. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = https://<render-app>.onrender.com/api`.

A couple of things worth knowing about the deployment:
- CORS already allows any `*.vercel.app` URL (plus whatever `FRONTEND_URL` is set to).
- Render's free disk is ephemeral, so SQLite resets on a redeploy or cold start. To handle that, the app
  **re-seeds the 5 sample meetings automatically** whenever the database is empty, so the demo is never blank.
  For durable user data you'd point `DATABASE_URL` at Postgres instead.

## Notes & assumptions

- **Single default user** — I didn't build real auth; there's a placeholder account menu instead.
- **No real audio** — the player is a simulated timeline driven by the transcript timestamps.
- **Groq for the AI** — summaries fall back to a local mock if the key is missing or the call fails, so
  creating a meeting never breaks.
- If you paste a transcript **without timestamps**, I synthesize reasonable ones so the player still works.
